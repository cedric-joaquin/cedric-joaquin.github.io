My first exposure to coding was an intro Java course in college. It was a pre-requisite class I needed for my bachelor's degree. In my mind at the time, it was just another course needed to pass. I had no interest in it back then.

Fast forward to the present -  I've been slowly becoming a sneakerhead and always had the worst luck in acquiring the shoes I want. That's when I learned about the botting scene. In this day and age, if you wanted to buy rare sneakers for retail price you absolutely *needed* to have a bot. There was just no way otherwise.

The thing is, bots themselves are also hard to acquire. The developers release limited copies, and things have evolved so much that there are *bots* to purchase other *bots*. I've always thought to myself what if I created my own bot? Where do I start? Is this easy? And that's where it all started. There's no looking back now.
